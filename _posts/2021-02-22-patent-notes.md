Per our recent communications the following are Richard & my notes regarding the Ghost Kitchen Delivery Van & Shops concept. Within, as well as attached to, this modified cargo van there are two items (I think are unique) that we are temporarily describing as:

1. The “Rubik’s Cube” package / locker sorting system located internally in the Van  
2. The “Swivel / 3-Bracket Loading Crane Arm” that will be used to place large packages into the Rubik’s Cube sorting system. This crane can be attached permanently to the Van or to the actual brick & mortar facility. Might also be portable...
3. The “Sunroof Loading Door” which is simply an extra large and extended sunroof for loading packages with the crane & sorter packaged along with it ...

Lots more to share and discuss but let’s start here ... Please review and I look forward to more discussions with you tomorrow at 3pm.
